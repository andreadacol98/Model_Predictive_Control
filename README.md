# Model Predictive Control
Implementation of a variety of MPC controllers for temperature regulation of a building. Specifically, the controller tracks the reference temperatures while satisfying safety constraints at all time steps. Modeled using simplified heat flows betwwen the rooms and the environment, the dynamical system is affected by exogenous disturbances, e.g. solar radiation.
